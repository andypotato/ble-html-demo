# BLE HTML Demo

A collection of examples which show how to use a Bluetooth controller with HTML5 applications. You need both the [Bluetooth controller](https://github.com/andypotato/ble-controller-demo) and [Bluetooth receiver](https://github.com/andypotato/ble-receiver-demo) to control these examples.

This project is part of a [tutorial on using Bluetooth Controllers with HTML5 / JavaScript applications](https://medium.com/@andreas.schallwig  "tutorial on using Bluetooth Controllers with HTML5 / JavaScript applications").

## Usage

 - Download or clone this repository
 - Install dependencies with `npm i`
 - Open `public/config.js` and set the websocket URL to your [Bluetooth receiver](https://github.com/andypotato/ble-receiver-demo)
 - Run the server with `npm run start`

You can now view the examples in your browser by opening `http://localhost:8080`.
